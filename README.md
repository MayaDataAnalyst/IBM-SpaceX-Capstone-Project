# About The Project
This project is part of IBM Applied Data Science Capstone. The primary objective of this project was to predict if Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. Falcon 9 rockets are launched by SpaceX. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars, while other providers cost over 165 million dollars over each launch. SpaceX achieves much of its savings through first-stage reusability. Therefore, it will be crucial to determine if the first stage will successfully land. SpaceX launch data was collected from the SpaceX API. The data contains information on the type of rocket used, payload mass (kg) delivered, launch specifications, landing specifications, and landing outcome. Four different machine learning techniques, including binary logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), classification tree, and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithms, were developed and compared. The candidate models had similar prediction performance for unseen, test samples. However, the classification tree slightly outperformed other alternative models in terms of the cross-validation accuracy measure.
