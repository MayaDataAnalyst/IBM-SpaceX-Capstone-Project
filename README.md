**About This Capstone Project
**
This project focuses on To do so, SpaceX launch data was collected from the SpaceX API. The data contains information on the type of rocket used, payload mass (kg) delivered, launch specifications, landing specifications, and landing outcome. The primary objective was to predict whether SpaceX will attempt to sucessfully land a rocket or not. For this purpose, four different machine learning techniques were developed and compared, which include binary logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), classification tree, and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithms.
