# About The Project
This project is part of the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone and focuses on predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage—a critical factor in reducing the cost of space launches. SpaceX advertises each Falcon 9 launch at approximately $62 million, significantly lower than other providers charging over $165 million per launch. A major reason for this cost advantage is first-stage reusability. Therefore, being able to predict whether the first stage will land successfully is crucial for assessing the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a launch. In the first phase, data was collected from the SpaceX API, capturing key information such as rocket type, payload mass (kg), launch and landing sites, mission specifics, and landing outcome (successful vs. failed). The data was then cleaned, structured, and visualized to explore relationships between different variables and the target outcome—landing success. Several interactive plots and exploratory visualizations were used to identify potential predictors. The next step involved building predictive models using four machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision tree classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Each model was tuned using GridSearchCV with 10-fold cross-validation. The model comparison results showed that decision tree model slightly outperformed the others in terms of cross-validation accuracy, though all models achieved similar results on the test set. The prediction outcomes from this project could be valuable for aerospace companies or contractors looking to bid against SpaceX for launch services.
